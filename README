django-mobile-views is a simple app to help detect mobile browsers
and serve a different template for them.

It works by inspecting the user agent.


To use, either use one of the mobile generic views, or add the MobileMixin
to your class based view.

from mobile_views.generic_views import MobileTemplateView

class HomePage(MobileTemplateView):
    template_name = 'myapp/home_page.html'
    mobile_template_name = 'myapp/mobile_home_page.html'


And that's it!

There is also a 'FullSiteView' provided that when accessed will set a cookie
to prevent being served the mobile template. The cookie lasts until browser close.
